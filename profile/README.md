Gardener communtiy consolidates [Gardener](https://github.com/gardener/) components as consumable helmcharts.
The charts released in [Gardener Charts](https://github.com/gardener-community/gardener-charts) provide a starting point for a Gardener deployment. 
Moreover, a chart for [Cloudprofiles](https://github.com/gardener-community/cloudprofiles) is maintained here. Feel free to open a PR to introduce your cloudprofiles, too.

A public demo Gardener installation using the resources defined here, can be found on [Okeanos](https://dashboard.okeanos.dev/login). On Okeanos, you are able to create Kubernetes clusters seamlessly, if you bring your own cloud credentials for any supported public cloud.
